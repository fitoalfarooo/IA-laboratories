# Lab 1 (Week 5)

1. Try  to  build  a  classifier  for  the  MNIST  dataset  that  achieves  over 97%  accuracy on  the  test  set.  Hint:  the  KNeighborsClassifier  works  quite well  for  this  task;you  just  need  to  find  good  hyperparameter  values  (try a  grid  search  on  the weights and n_neighbors hyperparameters).
 
2.Write a function that can shift an MNIST image in any direction (left, right, up,or down) by one pixel.5 Then, for each image in the training set, create four shif‐ted copies (one per direction) and add them to the training set. Finally, train your best model on this expanded training set and measure its accuracy on the test set.You should observe that your model performs even better now! This technique of artificially  growing  the  training  set  is  called data  augmentation  or  training  set expansion.
